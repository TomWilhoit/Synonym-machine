# Synonym-Machine

## Project description: 
Final assesment for Turing School of Software and Design.

#### Per the spec:
Vue.js + Merriam-Webster Thesaurus

"Create a single-page application in Vue.js that allows users to find synonyms for a word they search. The synonyms should be clickable - and when one is clicked, it should display the synonyms for that new word! Use the API to find synonyms. How you display things is up to you, but keep in mind the user experience"
